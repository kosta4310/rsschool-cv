### About me

For a long time I wanted to do my favorite thing - programming. At first, I learned Java on my own and started solving problems on codeabbey and chatting on the cyberforum.ru. Then, in the Data ocean sanction project, I studied the PostgreSQL language and applied it in practice. Now I am actively studying JAVASCRIPT. I like to learn something new, write code and enjoy its work, so I'm ready to delve into any direction in the IT-sphere. I want to say that I donâ€™t have bad habits, I can find a common language with people and I can work in a team.
